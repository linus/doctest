# ðŸ§ª doctest

`doctest` is no fuss [doctests][doctest] for Deno. Document your code with
[JSDoc][jsdoc], provide your [@example][example], and run your tests with
`deno test`.

![CI status](https://github.com/linus/doctest/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
![CodeQL status](https://github.com/linus/doctest/workflows/CodeQL/badge.svg)

## Usage

1. In your code, document your functions with JSDoc tags, providing `@example`
   tags for your examples:

```js
/**
 * A cool function
 *
 * @param {string} name
 * @returns {string} A greeting
 * @example hello("Mr von Neumann")
 * //=> "Hello, Mr von Neumann!"
 */
export function hello(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

**Notes**: The function under test **must** be exported, and it **cannot** be a
default export. Only named exports work. The expected result **must** be
prefixed with the string `//=>` on the beginning of a new line, after the
example code.

2. To execute the test, add a file which is discovered by `deno test` (e.g. in a
   `tests/` directory), and call `doctest` with the path to the file, relative
   to the project root, to be tested:

```js
import { doctest } from "https://deno.land/x/doctest@{VERSION}/mod.js";

/**
 * A test
 */
Deno.test("Tests", (t) => doctest(t, "hello.js"));
```

Where {VERSION} should be substituted with the specific version you want to use.

3. Run `deno test` and relax. Your code _and_ your examples are tested!

```bash
$ deno test

  Tests
    hello.js
      hello
        âœ” hello("Mr von Neumann")
//=> "Hello, Mr von Neumann!"


  1 passing (6ms)
```

## Advanced

`doctest` can handle Promises (in both examples and expected results), expected
Errors (both thrown Errors and rejected Promises), generator functions, and
more. Examples are in [spec](spec). This also acts as the specification and test
suite for `doctest`.

## Development

`doctest` is under active development. Pull requests are welcome:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the project to your own machine
3. Commit changes to a new branch of your fork
4. Push your work (making sure the code is tested!)
5. Submit a pull request
